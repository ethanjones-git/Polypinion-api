He reveals his closing argument and delivers a diatribe before being cut off.,"Donald Trump, the former U.S President, acted as his own closing argument on Thursday at the New York civil fraud trial. Trump was previously barred from giving the formal closing argument, however he took advantage of an opportunity to put forward his case. During his six-minute address, Trump defended his actions, stating that he ""did nothing wrong,"" and claimed his financial statements were “perfect"". Interestingly, Trump views the case brought against him as a form of election interference (https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-gives-closing-statement-in-nyag-trial-says-he-did-nothing-wrong-case-is-election-interference).
 
Trump's unexpected defense came after his lawyers finished their closing argument in the $370 million lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General, Letitia James (https://www.reuters.com/legal/trumps-370-million-civil-fraud-trial-set-conclude-ny-2024-01-11/). The lawsuit accuses Trump and his company of rampant fraud, allegations Trump strongly refutes. Trump's appearance in court was met with numerous attacks, abruptly ending his discourse that stirred the courtroom (https://apnews.com/b36abe2fd695d0172e71f8ef9c5ee7f3).  The remarkable closing arguments bring a preliminary conclusion to Trump's New York civil fraud trial, an event closely watched by the nation (https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/11/trump-new-york-fraud-trial-closing-arguments/).",2024-01-16 00:53:12

The FAA will consider whether the company ensured the aircraft's safety and followed inspection and testing procedures.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is officially investigating aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing after an incident where a panel flew off a plane while in mid-flight last week. The authorities are primarily looking into whether Boeing fully verified the safety of the panel and if it was manufactured according to the design that the FAA had previously approved (https://apnews.com/5c378e8080ae1bf1e3d3f7e68d498d5c). 

Further exposure of the matter shows that FAA's inquiry, as part of its quality control procedures, was provoked by a severe in-flight failure of a door plug on a new 737 Max 9. This investigation has the potential to uncover any possible oversights in the aircraft's production quality (https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/business/the-faa-is-formally-investigating-boeing-over-alaska-airlines-boeing-737-max-incident/index.html). 

Moreover, it's anticipated that the FAA will focus their investigations to clarify if Boeing failed in assuring the safety of its aircraft. Specifically, the FAA will determine if Boeing adhered to the quality system inspection and test processes when producing the said aircraft (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/11/faa-boeing-investigation-737-max/). This scrutinization aims to prioritize passenger safety by ensuring all in-flight components adhere to approved safety standards.

The funds will be directed towards the acquisition of gasoline-powered vehicles.","Hertz, a renowned rental firm, has decided to move away from its recent environmental push by announcing its plan to sell about 20,000 electric vehicles due to the higher expenses related to collision and damage associated with EVs. For quite some time, Hertz has been making a significant push into adopting electric vehicles into its fleet. Now, it seems that the company is reversing its trend as it intends to use the returns from the sale of its EVs to fund purchases of more gasoline-powered vehicles. The company perceives that more traditional, gas-based cars can potentially present a better balance of cost and performance, thus warranting this change. It remains to be seen how this shift will impact Hertz's standing in the market as the automotive industry continually responds to global climate concerns. ('https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/business/hertz-tesla-selling/index.html') ('https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hertz-sell-about-20000-evs-us-fleet-2024-01-11/')",2024-01-16 00:53:12

This is in response to an incident where a panel blew off a jetliner in midflight.,"Boeing, the renowned multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, is currently under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The focus of the inquiry revolves around a panel that came off one of Boeing's jetliners during a flight last week. The FAA is rigorously examining the circumstances to clarify if Boeing might have failed to ensure the plane was structurally sound and aligned with the design regulations the agency endorsed (https://apnews.com/5c378e8080ae1bf1e3d3f7e68d498d5c).

The agency is extending its probe into whether Boeing has adhered to the standard procedures related to quality system inspection and tests. FAA's aim is not just to determine the root cause of the recent panel detachment incident, but to certify that all Boeing's aircraft are safe for air travel. This follows due concern about whether the corporation failed to perform necessary safety checks prior to declaring their planes fit for flying (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/11/faa-boeing-investigation-737-max/).",2024-01-16 00:53:12

The inclement weather is causing significant disruption, as both political figures strive to gather support in the run-up to Monday's crucial presidential caucuses.

Both the United States and Britain marked the commencement of a coordinated effort to carry out strikes against targets linked to Houthis in Yemen, according to information disclosed by four U.S. officials.
